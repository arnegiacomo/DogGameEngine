# DogGame
- 2D game (unfinished) i made this in 2020 when learning to program, expansion on this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKs-3GhVKQ
- Demo ( NO AUDIO ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri1SCLIfGnQ
- How to use: Import eclipse (or other IDE) and clone git URI
- The game engine has a lot of unrealised potential, with sprite, terrain, animation, and entity systems, inventory system, ui system, basic pathfinding and directional attacks, audio playing, it can also load a level from a file. I regret not doing more, but it was a fun learning experience.
