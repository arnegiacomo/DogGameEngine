# DogGameEngine
- Java 2D game Engine (semi abandoned) i made this in 2020 when learning java, expansion of : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKs-3GhVKQ
- Demo (NO AUDIO AND WITH HITBOXES SHOWN) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri1SCLIfGnQ
- How to use: Clone URI and import to Eclipse (other IDEs might work, but would require configurations), should run natively on any platform, just click run.
- The game engine has a lot of unrealised potential, with sprites, terrain, animation, entity system, inventory system, ui system, basic pathfinding and directional attacks, audio playing, and level loading. I regret not doing more, but it was a fun learning experience.
