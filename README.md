# DogGameEngine
- Java 2D sprite based game Engine i started this in 2020 when learning java, expansion of : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKs-3GhVKQ
- Demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2egmCohbgPk
- How to use: Clone URI and import to Eclipse (other IDEs might work, but would require configurations), should run natively on any platform, just click run.
- Intention is to create a superlightweight game engine to run on most platforms
- The game engine has a lot of unrealised potential, with sprites, terrain, animation, entity system, inventory system, ui system, basic pathfinding and directional attacks, audio playing, and level generation.
- All code is undocumented, and kinda subpar. Dive in at own risk!
