# DogGameEngine
- Java 2D game Engine (abandoned) i made this in 2020 when learning java, expansion of : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKs-3GhVKQ
- Demo ( NO AUDIO ) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri1SCLIfGnQ
- How to use: Import eclipse (or other IDE) and clone git URI, should run natively on any platform, just click run
- The game engine has a lot of unrealised potential, with sprite, terrain, animation, entity systems, inventory system, ui system, basic pathfinding and directional attacks, audio playing,and level loading. I regret not doing more, but it was a fun learning experience.
